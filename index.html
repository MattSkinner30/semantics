<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A planet is a celestial body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally rounded and has “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit.</p>

<p>“I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.” — Neil Degrasse Tyson</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full planet hood.</p>
